## From start to finish how does that data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

It happens very fast with cables connected all of the world. HTML always loads first followed by CSS and then JS. Each browser has a rendering engine and a JS interpreter. The data is sent via packets. All browsers have DOM or document object model
